Estimate the average time (in ms) to access a sector on the following disk:

The average access time is the sum of the seek time, rotational latency, and transfer time.
The seek time is 4ms. Then on average we will have to wait 1/2 rotation of the disk for the correct sector to come under the head. So at 15,000 RPM it takes 1/15000 to rotate, so we add 1/15000 / 2. Transfer time is 1/800 of a revolution of a disk. So we add (1/15000)/800 ms.
