Perform levels 0 through 8 of the following tutorial: http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html. Save the contents of your sessions for each level for turn-in.  Note: At each level, you are logging in to the the same machine (i.e., bandit.labs.overthewire.org) as a new user corresponding to the level (e.g., bandit0 for level0, bandit1 for level1, etc.).  This might not be clear from the instructions.
